# Manipulator-Mechatronics
This repository showcases the statics, dynamics, and kinematics of a 2D robotic manipulator.
A two-link robot manipulator is modeled using a Proportional Derivative (PD) Controller for closed-loop operation of the arm. The PD gain parameters are hand-tuned to ensure optimal performance.
